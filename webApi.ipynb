    "## Q4. Explain REST and SOAP Architecture. Mention shortcomings of SOAP.\n",
    "### REST Architecture\n",
    "REST stands for REpresentational State Transfer and API stands for Application Program Interface. REST is a software architectural style that defines the set of rules to be used for creating web services. Web services which follow the REST architectural style are known as RESTful web services. It allows requesting systems to access and manipulate web resources by using a uniform and predefined set of rules. Interaction in REST based systems happen through Internet’s Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). \n",
    "\n",
    "#### A Restful system consists of a:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. client who requests for the resources.\n",
    "2. server who has the resources.\n",
    "3. It is important to create REST API according to industry standards which results in ease of development and increase client adoption. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Architectural Constraints of RESTful API:\n",
    "1. Uniform Interface\n",
    "2. Stateless\n",
    "3. Cacheable\n",
    "4. Client-Server\n",
    "5. Layered System\n",
    "6. Code on Demand\n",
    "### Soap Architecture\n",
    "SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is a message protocol that enables the distributed elements of an application to communicate. SOAP can be carried over a variety of standard protocols, including the web-related Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).\n",
    "#### SOAP building blocks and message structure example\n",
    "1. The SOAP Envelope encapsulates all the data in a message and identifies the XML document as a SOAP message.\n",
    "2. The Header element contains additional information about the SOAP message. This information could be authentication credentials, for example, which are used by the calling application.\n",
    "3. The Body element includes the details of the actual message that need to be sent from the web service to the calling application. This data includes call and response information.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How does SOAP work?\n",
    "SOAP requests are easy to generate and process responses. First, a request for a service is generated by a client using an XML document. Next, a SOAP client sends the XML document to a SOAP server. When the server receives the SOAP message, it sends the message as a service invocation to the requested server-side application. A response containing the requested parameters, return values and data for the client is returned first to the SOAP request handler and then to the requesting client. Both SOAP requests and responses are transported using Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) or a similar protocol like HTTP.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### shortcomings of SOAP:-\n",
    "1. Slow: SOAP uses XML format that must be parsed to be read. It defines many standards that must be followed while developing the SOAP applications. So it is slow and consumes more bandwidth and resource.\n",
    "2. WSDL dependent: SOAP uses WSDL and doesn't have any other mechanism to discover the service."

    "##Q5. Differentiate between REST and SOAP.\n",
    "SOAP stands for Simple Object Access Protocol and REST stands for Representational State Transfer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since SOAP is a protocol, it follows a strict standard to allow communication between the client and the server whereas REST is an architectural style that doesn’t follow any strict standard but follows six constraints defined by Roy Fielding in 2000. Those constraints are – Uniform Interface, Client-Server, Stateless, Cacheable, Layered System, Code on Demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "SOAP uses only XML for exchanging information in its message format whereas REST is not restricted to XML and its the choice of implementer which Media-Type to use like XML, JSON, Plain-text. Moreover, REST can use SOAP protocol but SOAP cannot use REST.\n",
    "\n",
    "On behalf of services interfaces to business logic, SOAP uses @WebService whereas REST instead of using interfaces uses URI like @Path.\n",
    "\n",
    "SOAP is difficult to implement and it requires more bandwidth whereas REST is easy to implement and requires less bandwidth such as smartphones.\n",
    "\n",
    "Benefits of SOAP over REST as SOAP has ACID compliance transaction. Some of the applications require transaction ability which is accepted by SOAP whereas REST lacks in it.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the basis of Security, SOAP has SSL( Secure Socket Layer) and WS-security whereas REST has SSL and HTTPS. In the case of Bank Account Password, Card Number, etc. SOAP is preferred over REST. The security issue is all about your application requirement, you have to build security on your own. It’s about what type of protocol you use.\n",
    "\n",
    "SOAP cannot make use of REST since SOAP is a protocol without any architectural pattern. REST can make use of SOAP because it is an architectural pattern having protocol."
