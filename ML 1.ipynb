    "\n",
    "Supervised learning is a type of machine learning in which a computer algorithm learns to make predictions or decisions based on labeled data. Labeled data is made up of previously known input variables (also known as features) and output variables (also known as labels). By analyzing patterns and relationships between input and output variables in labeled data, the algorithm learns to make predictions. Image and speech recognition, recommendation systems, and fraud detection are all examples of how supervised learning is used. The examples:-\n",

    "Unsupervised learning is when it can provide a set of unlabelled data, which it is required to analyze and find patterns inside. The examples are dimension reduction and clustering. The training is supported to the machine with the group of data that has not been labeled, classified, or categorized, and the algorithm required to facilitate on that data without some supervision. The objective of unsupervised learning is to restructure the input record into new features or a set of objects with same patterns.The examples:-\n",

This assumption is used to classify data points that occur less frequently as anomalies. Unsupervised techniques assign each data point a score instead of a label."
